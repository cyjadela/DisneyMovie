        The source of energy that moves the monster city is the screams of children?! The main energy source of the monster world is screams collected from human children. Monsters, Inc., made up of some of the best scare players, is a company dedicated to collecting such precious screams. One fatal problem with monsters is that human children can infect them with toxic poison. So monsters should never come into contact with children. When a young human girl, Boo, accidentally follows Sulli into the monster world, Sulli realizes that her career as well as her life could come to an end. Eventually, with Mike's help, Sulli finds a way to make up for her mistake. However, Sully, Mike, and Boo are immersed in a world of complex adventures they could not even imagine.
